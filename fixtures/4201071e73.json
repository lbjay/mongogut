Even today, even the most powerful computers need clever acceleration/approximation techniques to solve anything but the smallest problems. The COMPLETE solution to the physical state of any nebula is to solve for mean intensities J, ionization and excitation, and temperature.Thanks to the Variable Eddington Factor technique, one may use J instead of I, removing Nmu equations from the set. Since the equation set is block-tridiagonl, the solution times scales as N_iter * N_d *(Nnu + Nlev + Nc)^3. This becomes prohibitively large for most realistic problems. Solutions involve 1) Somehow reduce the size of the problem by some ALI method 2) Avoid recomputing Jacobian too often 3) Use approximate Newton-Raphson (his reference here is to Hillier1998)."

The only difference to normal Lambda iteration is that the Jacobian in the SSE equation system contains some (approximate) derivatives of J with respect to the local and neighboring level populations. In the non-Sobolev treatment, dJ_{ij}/dn_i terms are important (they essentually take derivative of the line source function). In the Sobolev limit, they compute dJ^b_{ij} / dn_i, but unclear how (here, the line source function is irrelevant). Key to this paper is that one can write J_k = Lambda[S_k] + sum_{k'} Gamma_{k,k'}[J_k'], which I havent understood yet."

NO linear equation systems have to be solved (frequency integral for bar(J) is taken as J at current frequency, actually tha Lambda operator is defined in terms of bar(J) instead of J_nu). The problem they are limited to is when the source function can be written as thermal + scattering term, and the scattering term depends only on the integral of the radiation field over angle and frequency (S = (1-eps)Lambda[S] + eps B). T and eps are assumed known. This is a two-level problem, or an equivalent two-level problem for multi-level atoms. \"Lambda is never assembled as a matrix operator when computing direct solutions (one does rays presumably).\" Normal (slow) Lambda iteration is S^{n+1} = (1-eps) S^n + eps B. The power of approximate Lambda operators (Lambda*) is they are IMPLICIT, and therefore mitigates the main problem of normal Lambda operators : the slow propagation of information through the grid. Note that it is NOT the fact that computation of Lambda*-1 is quicker then Lambda-1 that matters so much, but more the fact that we solve for S implicitly now.

Finds 0.2 Msun to be the limiting envelope mass below which the star shrinks and mass transfer by Roche lobe overflow stops. Best part is modeling of the light curve, both with a pure electron scattering (gray) radiation hydrodynamics code assuming LTE, and with the multi-group radiation transport (non-hydro) code EDDINGTON (used in LTE here). Applied a moderate amount of artificial mixing (including 56Ni). Bolometric light curves are essentially identical for the first LC bump (shock breakout, meaning that non-gray radiation transport effects are not important for this phase), but somewhat different for the second (56Ni-driven) bump. The SED produced by EDDINGTON assuming LTE agrees only moderately with observations, NLTE effects being important quite soon. This is an important conclusion : one cannot model photospheric phase spectra and photometry of SNe with an LTE code. Points out that because clumping is not modeled, one should not rule out models just because they differ slightly from observations, but do the modeling in a 'rough' way, ruling out extremes."

(1.1) A program should not require the reader to hold more than a few facts in memory at once. Break the code down into functions and modules of various complexity to achieve this. (1.4) Every step in software development should take no more than an hour's implementation. After this time our attention span drops and we make mistakes. Also, interruptions causes us to lose the workflow. (2.1) Use computers for any REPETITIVE tasks and (2.2) for saving complex commands. (2.3) Use BUILD tools to automate workflows.  (3.1) Use the computer to track workflow automatically (as a notebook)  (5.2) Anything created manually (source code, paper drafts) should be put under version control  (6.1) Every piece of data must have one and only one representation on the system..dont have several copies lying around in several directories or on several computers. (6.2) On large scale, reuse existing (and tested) code rather than writing your own, especially for core operations such as matrix inversions. (7.1) Use defensive programming : write checks in input variables etc. (7.2) Use a testing library for all your units.  (7.4) Have access to and use a symbolic debugger to be able to trace code flow.  (8.1) Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks in the code.  (8.2) Use as high-level language as possible, it goes faster and produces fewer errors.  (9.1) Organise the code well and you rarely have to explain what each line does. Instead, explain purpose and logic of things. (9.3) Put documentation IN the software, not as a separate document  (10.1) Use code reviews : let other people inspect code just as when they inspect your paper drafts.  (10.2) Use an issue tracking tool to keep track of the development process."
