Thanks to the high throughput of the EPIC instrument, \u02dc360 000 photons were collected from the source, allowing a very sensitive study of the temporal and spectral behaviour of this object. The spectral data, both time-averaged and phase-resolved, yield one compelling interpretation of the observed features: cyclotron absorption from one fundamental (\u02dc0.7 keV) and three harmonics, at \u02dc1.4, \u02dc2.1 and \u02dc2.8 keV. Possible physical consequences are discussed, also on the basis of the obvious phase variations of the features' shapes and depths. We also present deep VLT optical data which we have used to search for a counterpart, with negative results down to V\u02dc27.

As the luminosity and thus the mass estimate depend on the association of HLX-1 with ESO 243-49, it is essential to confirm its affiliation. This requires follow-up investigations at wavelengths other than X-rays, which in turn needs an improved source position. To further reinforce the IMBH identification, it is necessary to determine HLX-1's environment to establish whether it could potentially form and nourish a black hole at the observed luminosities. Using the High Resolution Camera on board Chandra, we determine a source position of R.A. = 01<SUP>h</SUP>10<SUP>m</SUP>28.<SUP>s</SUP>3 and decl. = -46\u00b004'22farcs3. A conservative 95% error of 0farcs3 was found following a boresight correction by cross-matching the positions of three X-ray sources in the field with the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog. Combining all Swift UV/Optical Telescope uvw2 images, we failed to detect a UV source at the Chandra position down to a 3\u03c3 limiting magnitude of 20.25 mag. However, there is evidence that the UV emission is elongated in the direction of HLX-1. This is supported by archival data from GALEX and suggests that the far-UV emission is stronger than the near-UV. This could imply that HLX-1 may be situated near the edge of a star-forming region. Using the latest X-ray observations, we deduce the mass accretion rate of a 500 M <SUB>sun</SUB> black hole with the observed luminosity and show that this is compatible with such an environment.", "bibcode": "2010ApJ...712L.107W", "type": "science"}, "2010MNRAS.401.1620H": {"abstract": "We present results of simulations of the spectrum of the accretion flow on to the supermassive black hole in our Galactic Centre, Sagittarius A*, generated with a coupling of Monte Carlo (MC) radiation and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic codes.

We present near-infrared observations of the supernova SN 2003lw, which exploded in the host galaxy of GRB 031203. Our deep high-resolution Magellan data establish that this SN is spatially coincident with the radio and X-ray localizations of the afterglow of GRB 031203 to subarcsecond precision and is thus firmly associated with the GRB. We use image differencing to subtract the bright emission from the host galaxy and measure the SN flux at ~5, ~7, and ~50 days after the GRB. Our J-band measurements are inconsistent with predictions derived by placing SN 1998bw (associated with GRB 980425) at z=0.1055. In particular, our early data points show that before peak, SN 2003lw was significantly fainter in rest frame ~1.13 \u03bcm (observed J band) than SN 1998bw.

The enhancements extend from a radius of 20 kpc from the central galaxy to a distance of ~120 kpc. We estimate the total iron mass that has been transported out of the central galaxy to be between 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> and 7 \u00d7 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB>, which represents 10%-30% of the iron mass within the central galaxy.

Our new spectroscopic observations have revealed the expected AGN features also in the optical band. These results clearly show that optical spectroscopy sometimes can be inefficient in revealing the presence of an AGN, which instead is clearly found from an X-ray spectroscopic investigation. This remarks the importance of being careful in proposing the identification of X-ray sources (especially at faint fluxes) when only low quality optical spectra are in hand.

The steep decline in L<SUB>X</SUB> was at odds with the previous two decades of high-energy measurements, which showed only modest variability of the Sun-like star. A  Chandra LETGS spectrum in 2007 June, however, fully resolved the source of the curious X-ray darkening: a depletion of plasma above ~2 MK had substantially depressed the line spectrum where the XMM-Newton response peaks (\u03bb<~30 \u00c5), even though the overall coronal luminosity, dominated by longer wavelength emissions, had declined only slightly. This is reminiscent of the Sun's magnetic activity cycle, where the 2-3 MK active regions of sunspot maximum give way to the spatially pervasive, but cycle-independent, 1 MK ``quiet corona'' at minimum. This emphasizes that any discussion of cyclic coronal variability in low-activity stars will depend crucially on the energy coverage of the measurements.", "bibcode": "2008ApJ...678L.121A", "type": "science"}, "2006A&A...454..165P": {"abstract": "In this paper we test the idea that the low-metallicity hot gas in the centre of NGC 1291 is heated via a dynamical process. In this scenario, the gas from the outer gas-rich ring loses energy through bar-driven shocks and falls to the centre. Heating of the gas to X-ray temperatures comes from the high velocity that it reaches (&ap;700 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) as it falls to the bottom of the potential well. This would explain why the stellar metallicity in the bulge region is around solar while the hot gas metallicity is around 0.1 solar. We carried out an observational test to check this hypothesis by measuring the metallicity of HII regions in the outer ring to check whether they matched the hot gas metallicity. For this purpose we obtained medium resolution long slit spectroscopy with FORS1 on the ESO VLT at Paranal and obtained the metallicities using emission line ratio diagnostics. The obtained metallicities are compatible with the bulge stellar metallicities but very different from the hot-gas metallicity. However, when comparing the different time-scales, the gas in the ring had time enough to get enriched through stellar processes, therefore we cannot rule out the dynamical mechanism as the heating process of the gas. However, the blue colours of the outer ring and the dust structures in the bar region could suggest that the origin of the X-ray hot gas is due to the infall of material from further out.", "bibcode": "2006A&A...454..165P", "type": "science"}, "2003ApJ...588..992R": {"abstract": "We present an X-ray and radio study of the wind nebula surrounding the central pulsar PSR J1811-1925 in the supernova remnant G11.2-0.3.

The new X-ray data allow us to separate the synchrotron emission of the pulsar wind nebula from the surrounding thermal emission and that from the pulsar itself. On the basis of X-ray data from two epochs, we observe temporal variation of the location of X-ray hot spots near the pulsar, indicating relativistic motion. We compare thermal emission observed within the shell, which may be associated with the forward shock of the pulsar wind nebula, to thermal emission from a nearby portion of the remnant shell, the temperature of which implies an expansion velocity consistent with the identification of the remnant with the historical event of 386 A.D. The measured X-ray and radio spectral indices of the nebula synchrotron emission are found to be consistent with a single synchrotron cooling break. The magnetic field implied by the break frequency is anomalously large, given the apparent size and age of the nebula, if a spherical morphology is assumed but is consistent with a bipolar morphology.", "bibcode": "2003ApJ...588..992R", "type": "science"}}
